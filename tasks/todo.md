# AstroSharper — Project Memory

A running record of where we are, what's done, and what's next. Update at the end of every session.

## Current state (v0.2.0 + unreleased)

- Native macOS app, Swift 5.9 + Metal, macOS 14+
- Full lucky-imaging pipeline operational: SER (mono + Bayer) → quality grade → multi-AP align → weighted accumulate → bake-in (sharpen + tone) → 16-bit float TIFF
- Three-section UI (Inputs · Memory · Outputs) with stash-on-switch state
- Sandbox-safe with security-scoped bookmarks + container fallback
- Preset system with smart auto-detection + iCloud sync (10 built-ins)
- Brand identity, About / How-To windows, app icon, version display
- Apply ALL Stuff hero button (⇧⌘A)
- Cmd zoom shortcuts (⌘= ⌘- ⌘0 ⌘1 ⌘2)
- R-key reference frame marker
- Three alignment modes: full frame, disc centroid, reference ROI
- Stabilize-from-memory preserves in-place edits

## Done — recent batches

### Solar stabilization fix (current session)
- DC removal before Hann window — fixes solar disc drift
- Reference frame marker (R key, gold star)
- Three alignment modes (full frame / disc centroid / reference ROI)
- ROI capture from current preview viewport
- Stabilize-from-memory uses memory textures (preserves in-place edits)
- Pre-flight confirm before re-aligning over edited frames
- ReferenceMode picker: marked / firstSelected / brightestQuality
- Append "aligned" to appliedOps trail instead of resetting
- Click-anywhere section header collapse
- AVI catalog recognition + friendly fallback for lucky-stack

### D14 — UX polish
- Inline player, status-bar path, lighter accent, thumbnail normalising fix
- Lucky Stack section gating when no SER files present

### D13 — Memory workflow
- Mini-player, per-section apply hero buttons, smart suffix naming
- Sortable file-list columns, How-To floating window

### D12 — Brand + scaffolding
- Brand identity, About panel, How-To window, app icon, version display

## Pending — roadmap

### Near-term
- [ ] AVI demuxing for Lucky Stack (`AVAssetReader` → frame buffer adapter)
- [ ] 16-bit histogram overlay on preview (currently using basic Histogram)
- [ ] Drizzle 1.5×, 2× reconstruction (C5 task)
- [ ] CompiledFFT path: re-enable MPSGraph phase correlator (currently disabled, vDSP CPU path is the active route)

### App Store path
- [ ] Replace `idPLACEHOLDER` in `AppLinks.appStoreReview` with real App Store ID
- [ ] Apple notarization workflow (notarytool integration)
- [ ] Privacy manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`)
- [ ] App Store screenshots (required: 1280×800, 1440×900, 2560×1600, 2880×1800)
- [ ] App Store description, keywords, support URL
- [ ] Pricing tier decision

### Mid-term
- [ ] FITS / RAW / DNG input
- [ ] Pre-stack calibration frames (darks / flats / bias)
- [ ] Folder watching (auto-batch on new files)
- [ ] Animated preview transitions (zoom-to-1:1 etc.)
- [ ] Color-aware tone curve (per-channel splines)
- [ ] Star-aware sharpening for deep-sky (out of scope for v1)

- [x] docs/wiki/ — Home, Getting-Started, Lucky-Stack, Stabilization, Sharpening, Tone-Curve, Presets, Keyboard-Shortcuts, File-Formats, Output-Folders, Troubleshooting, FAQ
- [x] tasks/lessons.md
- [x] tasks/todo.md (this file)
- [ ] LICENSE file (MIT)
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Screenshots / GIFs in README

## Test images

`TESTIMAGES/` holds sample SER captures used during development. Don't commit personal captures with metadata that could leak location.

## Known limitations

- AVI lucky-stack support is stubbed — engine is SerReader-coupled
- MPSGraph FFT path is disabled (vDSP CPU path is active and working)
- Multi-AP grid >12×12 may exceed threadgroup memory on older Apple Silicon
- Centroid alignment requires the disc to be brighter than ~25 % of max luminance — overexposed shots without a clear background fail
- Notarization not yet automated — manual step before Release builds
